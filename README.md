# Crypto
Hello. This program is made for the encryption and decryption of the information in the text file. 
It is processed in Java programming language on Inteligld platform. 
To release the program just open it in your Inteligld: in src fold you’ll see data1.txt file, in which you can type any information. 
Further doing “run” the program with the encrypt version of the information you typed you can see in data2.txt file,and the decrypt version,which has the same form you’ve typed in data3.txt file. 
The program itself contains of one class and one interface. 
There are two written functions in the class: Encryption algorithm that do opposite actions to restore the encrypt version again.
